        <h1>How FITM Works</h1>

        <section>
            <h2 id="cats" class="subsection">Meow</h2>
            <p><em>Cats</em> are an important component. Their name is a shorthand for <em><a href="#tags">tag categories</a></em>. And as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_Has_Cheezburger%3F">classic Internet symbol</a>, cats seem well fitted for a part in ruling FITM. Don't be alarmed by mention of "stacking cats"; no animals were harmed making this.</p>
            <p>Links submitted are tagged with cats, and you can specify in searches which cats the links must have. All links from a search will have the specified cats (and likely some others) in their tags.</p>
            <p>The most common cats from the links found in a search are listed in order of frequency. Searches with cat filters applied return top <em>subcats</em>: the most common cats from returned links, not including the filtered ones. From these you can <em>stack cats</em> further: click a top cat or subcat to add it as a constraint, drilling deeper and more precisely into the original cross section of found links.</p>

                <li><strong>Summarize</strong></li>

            </ol>
            <h3 class="subsection">Summarize</h3>
            <p>
                Every link has a summary page where any user can
                submit a description of its content. Summaries can be upvoted so the most liked ones are most visible.
            </p>
            <p>
                A link's top summary will be shown above its URL at all times to
                quickly give a sense for what it is.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subsection">Copy</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Copying</strong> links to your Treasure Map improves
                discoverability via proliferation. It allows you to easily find a
                link again or let others find it by reading your Treasure Map.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subsection">Like</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Liking</strong> improves discoverability via corroboration.
                It's a way to vouch for a link's "goodness" (comprehensiveness, authenticity, hilarity, whatever).
            </p>
            <p>
                Liking helps great content appear closer to the top of searches,
                so anyone can find it easily.
            </p>
            <h3 id="tags" class="subsection">Tag</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Tagging</strong> links improves discoverability
                via filtration. A tag is a list of categories (cats) for a link, chosen by you. It's your interpretation of the topics that the link may be associated with, or terms that you expect someone interested in the link would search for.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't have to agree on the most accurate cat(s) for any link. Each tag author's configuration is recorded, and can be found on their Treasure Map.
            </p>
        </section>

			<h2> The Global Treasure Map and Global Tags</h2>
			<p>
				Any <em>user-submitted tag</em> (cats assigned to a link)
				decides how the link is sorted on the tag author's Treasure Map. But every link also has a <em>global tag</em>,
				which determines its sorting on the <a href='/search'>Search</a
			> and <a href='/more'>More</a> pages.
			</p>
			<p><em>Global tags</em> are calculated automatically by the age of every
			<em>user-submitted tag</em> and the frequency of each cat across
			them. They're shown with each link. (Unless, again, the link is viewed from a user's Treasure Map; then it will show <em>their</em> tag.) You can view any link's top user-submitted tags on demand.</p>

			<p>Each user-submitted tag shows its <em>lifespan overlap percentage</em> (see <a href="#global-tag-calculation">Global Tag Calculation</a>), author, date of submission, and cats. Tags that have kept the same combination of cats for the greatest portion of the link's lifespan are ranked highest. Editing a tag's cats will reset it's lifespan overlap percentage.</p>

			<p>To clarify, a link's global cats will not necessarily be exclusive to its highest-ranked tags. If many newer tags contain some cats that are not already present in the global tag, it's likely that those too will soon be assigned.</p>

			<p>This system is based on the assumption that cat interpretations that remain unedited
			for a long time or that reappear across tags are most likely to be the best fits.</p>

			<p>A long-unchanged tag could still be a poor representation, but if enough people disagree and submit alternative tags their collective input will nullify it; the old tag's cats will likely be removed from the link's global tag.</p>

			<h2 id="global-tag-calculation" class="subsection">Global Tag Calculation</h2>
			<p>Note: <a href="/feedback">constructive criticism welcomed</a> for this system.</p>
			<p>For a cat to be added to link <code>L</code>'s global tags, it's <em>score</em> must be &ge;25% of the highest score among <code>L</code>'s cats.</p>
			<p><em>Scores</em> for cat <code>C</code> of link <code>L</code> are calculated as the sum of scores from each occurrence of <code>C</code> in one of <code>L</code>'s tags. Each score is weighted by the number of cats in the tag containing the occurrence.</p>
			<p>Weights for tag <code>T</code> are calculated as <em>lifespan overlap percentage</em> of <code>T</code>, divided by <code>T</code>'s number of cats. </p>
			<p>Lifespan overlap percentage for tag <code>T</code> of link <code>L</code> is the percentage of <code>L</code>'s time on FITM that  <code>T</code> has remained in its current state since creation or last edit.</p>

            <h2 id="retrieving-metadata" class="subsection">Retrieving Metadata</h2>
			<p>FITM employs <em>very limited</em> use of automated website scraping to fetch <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metadata for submitted links. These requests can be identified by the <strong>FITM-Bot</strong> user agent.</p>

			<p>A max of 1-3 automated requests go out to each submitted URL (FITM-Bot tries different protocol prefixes, e.g., "https://" and "http://", if the first request fails). This automated scraping helps to cut down on link submission friction and pair links with eye-catching preview images. The goal is ultimately to promote appreciation for good, public Internet sites by improving their visibility.</p>

			<p><strong>Anyone can have their domain added to a non-scrape list upon request, with no further questions</strong>. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@fitm.online">support@fitm.online</a> if you'd like that. It would be an odd decision though. The traffic is miniscule, and the point of sites being on FITM is to help them get more visitors. Wouldn't you want more visitors?</p>
