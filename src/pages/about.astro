			<p>
				The <strong>Flexible Internet Treasure Map (FITM)</strong>
				is a dynamic database of valued Internet content. With it you can share links that are worth knowing and easily search existing archives. Its goal is to help everyone find more of what they love.
			</p>

			<p>It is <em>flexible</em> because links can be organized and queried using a variety of properties to help find perfect matches for your current wishes.</p>

			<p>
				<em>Treasure</em> is intentionally vague. This place is meant for sharing and
				discovering anything on the Internet that's worth sharing or
				discovering.
			</p>

			<p>It is an attempted solution to
				the challenges of high obscurity and poor discoverability
				of Internet greatness, new and old.</p>

			<h2>How FITM Works</h2>

			<h3 id="cats" class="subsection">Cats?</h3>
			<p><em>"Cats"</em> are an important concept here. It&apos;s a shorthand for <em><a href="#tags">tag categories</a></em>. Cats are also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_Has_Cheezburger%3F">historically prominent Internet symbol</a>, so it seems fitting that they'd be a part of FITM. Don't be alarmed by mention of "stacking cats"; no animals were harmed in building this site.</p>

			<p>Links submitted to FITM are tagged with 1+ cats. You can apply cat filters in searches to easily and reliably find pages that match some
			theme(s). All links returned in a search will have the cats you specify, and maybe also others.</p>

			<p>You can also filter results by time period (last day, week, month, or year) or whether you want to include results that are tagged "<abbr title="Not Safe For Work">NSFW</abbr>". (NSFW is always opt-in.)</p>

			<p>The top (most used) cats are listed along with returned links that match your chosen constraints. Searches with cat filters return top <em>subcats</em>. These are the most used cats found throughout the returned links, not including the ones you specified.</p>

			<SearchDiagram />

			<h3 id="core-actions" class="subsection">Core Actions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Summarize</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Copy</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Like</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Tag</strong></li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="subsection">Summarize</h3>
			<p>
				Every link has a summary page where any user can
				submit a description of its content. Summaries can be upvoted so the most liked ones stay most visible.
			</p>
			<p>
				A link's top summary will be shown above its URL at all times to
				quickly give a sense for what it is.
			</p>

			<h3 class="subsection">Copy</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Copying</strong> a link to your Treasure Map is about improving
				discoverability via proliferation. It allows you to easily find a
				link again or let others find it by reading your Treasure Map.
			</p>

			<h3 class="subsection">Like</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Liking</strong> is about improving discoverability via corroboration.
				It's a way to vouch for a link's "goodness" (comprehensiveness, authenticity, hilarity, whatever).
			</p>
			<p>
				Liking helps great content appear closer to the top of searches,
				so anyone can find it easily.
			</p>

			<h3 id="tags" class="subsection">Tag</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Tagging</strong> a link is about improving discoverability
				via filtration. A tag is a list of categories (cats) for a link, chosen by you. It's your interpretation of the topics that the link may be associated with, or terms that you expect someone interested in the link may search for with cat filters.
			</p>
			<p>
				We need not agree on the most accurate cat(s) for all links. Each user's take matters, and can be found by viewing their Treasure Map.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3> The Global Treasure Map and Global Tags</h3>
			<p>
				Any <em>user-submitted tag</em> (cats assigned to a link)
				decides how the link is sorted on the tag author's Treasure Map. But every link also has a <em>global tag</em>,
				which determines its sorting on the <a href='/top'>Top</a
			> and <a href='/more'>More</a> pages.
			</p>
			<p><em>Global tags</em> are calculated automatically by the age of every
			<em>user-submitted tag</em> and the frequency of each cat across
			them. They're shown with each link. (Unless, again, the link is viewed from a user's Treasure Map; then it will show <em>their</em> tag.) You can view any link's top user-submitted tags on demand.</p>

			<p>Each user-submitted tag shows its <em>lifespan overlap percentage</em> (see <a href="#global-tag-calculation">Global Tag Calculation</a>), author, date of submission, and cats. Tags that have kept the same combination of cats for the greatest portion of the link's lifespan are ranked highest. Editing a tag's cats will reset it's lifespan overlap percentage.</p>

			<p>To clarify, a link's global cats will not necessarily be exclusive to its highest-ranked tags. If many newer tags contain some cats that are not already present in the global tag, it's likely that those too will soon be assigned.</p>

			<p>This system is based on the assumption that cat interpretations that remain unedited
			for a long time or that reappear across tags are most likely to be the best fits.</p>

			<p>A long-unchanged tag could still be a poor representation, but if enough people disagree and submit alternative tags their collective input will nullify it; the old tag's cats will likely be removed from the link's global tag.</p>

			<h2>Why?</h2>
			<p>What problems does FITM address that existing search or sharing tools don't?</p>
			<h3 class="subsection">Search Engines</h3>
			<p>
				Search engines help with indexing the web,
				but they don't think like people so they struggle to grasp your wishes and make useful recommendations. And they have some biases.
			</p>
			<p>
				Depending on your definition of quality, <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors#top-8">as we now know it</a> may or may not be relevant.
				Great things on the web may be absent in search results because they're not aggressively stuffed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_research">keywords</a>, or they're not linked from many other pages, or they're not associated with an advertised company <a href="https://digitalbrandinginstitute.com/improve-brand-signals-better-seo#:~:text=What%20Are,Signals?">brand</a>. Or, maybe a site ranks highly given specific search terms but is otherwise hard to discover. How could you even know to search for something <a href="https://presidentialham.com/">like this</a>? (safe for work.) Internet users who care most
				about result <em>novelty</em> don't really benefit from these ranking metrics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Search engines also are incentivized to promote results from
				those who will pay for it. Maybe this is a
				feature, not a bug, depending on who you ask. Do ad budgets and marketing passion reliably produce high quality web content? If you're not sure about that, you may be in the right place. (You will never see ads on FITM).
			</p>
			<p>
				A simple-enough and reliable-enough proxy for a link's quality is the number of
				<em>people</em> who decide, for any reason, to upvote it. Then it's easy to find good content by putting the most liked links at the top of searches.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sorting by likes is not enough, though. That's why you can parameterize FITM searches with <em><a href="#cats">cat-stacking</a></em> and other sorting and filtering.
			</p>

			<h3 class="subsection">Reddit</h3>
			<p>
				Some might argue that the goal of categorizing web content was achieved long ago by Reddit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reddit is an invaluable resource
				and a blessing. It's an inspiration to FITM. But they have different purposes.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Reddit is
						mainly a communication hub while FITM is mainly a resource hub. FITM is not meant for thematic
						discussion, only link sharing and
						discovery (with a few text submission actions in support of that goal: see <a href="#core-actions">Core Actions</a>).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Subreddits are communities defined by one key theme. But FITM aims, through cat-stacking, to serve anyone
						interested in something that spans multiple specific themes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most web
						searches implicitly treat keywords like they're separated with "OR" when sometimes what you want is for them to be separated with "AND." History AND comedy AND music AND videos. That search could very quickly escort you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6OOuPI5c0">this masterpiece</a>. (probably not safe for work.)
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

			<h3 id="global-tag-calculation" class="subsection">Global Tag Calculation</h3>
			<p>Note: <a href="/feedback">constructive criticism welcomed</a> for this system.</p>
			<p>For a cat to be added to link <code>L</code>'s global tags, it's <em>score</em> must be &ge;25% of the highest score among <code>L</code>'s cats.</p>
			<p><em>Scores</em> for cat <code>C</code> of link <code>L</code> are calculated as the sum of scores from each occurrence of <code>C</code> in one of <code>L</code>'s tags. Each score is weighted by the number of cats in the tag containing the occurrence.</p>
			<p>Weights for tag <code>T</code> are calculated as <em>lifespan overlap percentage</em> of <code>T</code>, divided by <code>T</code>'s number of cats. </p>
			<p>Lifespan overlap percentage for tag <code>T</code> of link <code>L</code> is the percentage of <code>L</code>'s time on FITM that  <code>T</code> has remained in its current state since creation or last edit.</p>

			<GlobalTagCalcDiagram />

			<h3 id="retrieving-metadata" class="subsection">Retrieving Metadata</h3>
			<p>FITM employs <em>very limited</em> use of automated website scraping in order to fetch metadata for submitted links. This includes a description (AKA "Auto Summary") and a preview image, which come from <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> properties and other meta tags in a page's HTML head. FITM metadata collection can be identified by requests coming from the <strong>FITM-Bot</strong> user agent.</p>

			<p>A max of 1-3 automated requests go out to each URL added here (FITM-Bot tries a couple times with different protocol prefixes, e.g., "https://" and "http://", if the first request fails). This automated scraping helps to cut down on link submission friction and pair links with eye-catching visuals. The goal is ultimately to promote appreciation for good, public Internet sites by improving their visibility.</p>

			<p><strong>Anyone can have their domain added to a non-scrape list upon request, with no further questions</strong>. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:fitm-contact@proton.me">fitm-contact@proton.me</a> if you'd like that. It would be an odd decision though. Bot traffic is miniscule, and the point of sites being on FITM is to help them get more visitors.</p>
