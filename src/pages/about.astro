			<h2>Benefits</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Objective, relevant recommendations.</strong> Link rankings correlate directly with cumulative user interactions, so highly-ranked links have reason to be trusted. Filtering to match various conditions is easy and reliable. Finding what most people recommend for some topic couldn't be simpler&mdash;by default, the most-liked links from any search go first. Because fairness and accountability are crucial in this exchange, FITM's ranking formula is open source and made to be easily understood. Searches do exactly what they say they'll do, nothing more, nothing less. Likes, copies, tags, etc. can all be verified using public data.</li>

				<li><strong>Maximal search precision.</strong> Matching <em>all</em>&mdash;not <em>any</em>&mdash; of your keywords (cats). In exchange for not getting an endless recommendation stream, you get sniper-like concentration on the most noteworthy handful. Incrementally adding or removing specificity by stacking or un-stacking cats allows you to fine-tune the breadth of your search results to be just right.</li>

				<li><strong>No distractions.</strong> FITM is more like a library or art gallery than a bar&mdash;an efficient pipeline for accessing the documented world. No being inundated with obnoxious ads or other unsolicited fluff. By design, there is very little social messaging. You're encouraged to effortlessly locate specific material using specialized search tools, or to wander amid new ideas and see what provokes interest. Either way, casual communication is not only not necessary but would be counterproductive. Further efforts to issue Internet guidance in a conversational format would resemble existing ones. We have those and they satisfy a different need. Bars work well for relaxed socializing. Museums, being designed for focus, are better for the pursuit of new knowledge and experience. And they wouldn't be conducive to focus if they contained raucous taprooms. Similarly, to provide you with purposefully curated online delights and the focus to thoroughly enjoy them, FITM neglects comments, direct messaging, and other fun but innapropriate attention-callers.</li>
