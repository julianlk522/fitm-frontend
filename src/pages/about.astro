				The <strong>Flexible Internet Treasure Map (FITM)</strong>
				is a system for pooling and organizing valuable Internet content. You can use it to share links that you think are worth knowing about, or to easily sort through other links that the community has shared.
			</p>

			<p>It is <em>flexible</em> because links can be grouped and queried using a variety of properties to help you locate what you want.</p>
			<p>
				<em>Treasure</em> is intentionally vague. This site is about sharing or
				discovering anything on the Internet that's worth sharing or
				discovering.
			</p>

			<p>It is an attempted solution to
				the challenges of high obscurity and resultingly low discoverability
				of Internet greatness, both new and old. </p>

			<h2>How FITM Works</h2>

			<h3 id="cats" class="subsection">Cats?</h3>
			<p>The term <em>"cats"</em> is used often here. It&apos;s a shorthand for <em><a href="#tags">tag categories</a></em>. Cats are also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_Has_Cheezburger%3F">historically prominent Internet symbol</a>, so it seems fitting that they'd help run FITM. Please don't be alarmed by mention of "stacking cats" or things of that nature. No animals were harmed in making this site.</p>

			<p>Links submitted to FITM are tagged with 1+ cats. You can stack desired cats in
			searches to quickly and reliably find pages that match some
			theme(s). You can also specify other filters, like a time period (last day, week, month, or year) during which the returned links must have been posted, or whether you want to see anything tagged "<abbr title="Not Safe For Work">NSFW</abbr>". (NSFW is always opt-in.)</p>

			<p>The top (most used) cats will be listed along with returned links matching your desired parameters. Searches with cat filters return top <em>subcats</em>. In other words, the most used cats found across the subsection of links returned in your search, not including the ones you specified.</p>

			<h3 id="core-actions" class="subsection">Core Actions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Summarize</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Copy</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Like</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Tag</strong></li>
			</ol>

			<h3 class="subsection">Summarize</h3>
			<p>
				Every added link has a summary page where any user can
				submit their summary of its content. Summaries can be upvoted to help the most liked ones stay most visible.
			</p>
			<p>
				A link's top summary will be shown above its URL at all times to
				quickly give a sense for what it is.
			</p>

			<h3 class="subsection">Copy</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Copying</strong> a link to your Treasure Map is about improving
				discoverability via proliferation. It allows you to easily find a
				link again or let others find it by reading your Treasure Map.
			</p>

			<h3 class="subsection">Like</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Liking</strong> is about improving discoverability via corroboration.
				It's a way to vouch for the "goodness" (comprehensiveness, authenticity, hilarity,
				etc.) of a link without needing to pin it to your Treasure Map and take up space there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Liking allows great content to filter to the top of searches,
				so that everyone&mdash;even those who don't know to check your
				Treasure Map&mdash;can find it easily.
			</p>

			<h3 id="tags" class="subsection">Tag</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Tagging</strong> a link is about improving discoverability
				via filtration. A tag is a list of categories, chosen by a user, that a certain link is thought to embody. It represents that user's interpretation of the link's content. Tag cats can be specified in searches to narrow results.
			</p>
			<p>
				Obviously not everyone agrees on preferred categorizations of
				various links. Each user is invited to tag any link however they
				see fit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any <em>user-submitted tag</em>, i.e., a user's categorization(s) of some link,
				dictates how that link will be indexed on <em>their</em> Treasure Map. By contrast, links are indexed using <em>global tags</em> in Global Treasure Map searches.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>

			<h3> The Global Treasure Map and Global Tags</h3>
			<p>
				Each link is also associated with a <em>global tag</em>,
				which filters the results of searches made outside of a single
				user's map (i.e., on the <a
				href='/top'>Top</a
			> and <a href='/more'>More</a> pages).
			</p>
			<p><em>Global tags</em> are calculated automatically by the age of every
			<em>user-submitted tag</em> and the frequency of each cat across
			them. They are shown with each link. (Unless the link is viewed from a user's Treasure Map. Then it will show <em>that</em> user's tag.) You can also view any link's top user-submitted tags on demand.</p>

			<p>Each user-submitted tag shows its <em>lifespan overlap percentage</em> (see <a href="#global-tag-calculation">Global Tag Calculation</a>), author, date of submission, and cats. Tags that have kept the same combination of cats for the greatest portion of the link's lifespan are ranked highest. Editing a tag's cats will reset it's lifespan overlap percentage.</p>

			<p>To clarify, not only the cats contained in the top tag rankings may be assigned globally. If many recent tags contain the same cats which are not already present in the global tag, it's likely that those too will be assigned.</p>

			<p>This system is based on the assumption that cat interpretations that remain unedited
			for a long time or that reappear across tags are most likely to be the best fits.</p>

			<p>A long-unchanged tag could be bad (poorly representing its link), but if enough people disagree and submit alternative tags, their collective input will rule it out; the old tag's cats will be stripped from the link's global tag.</p>

			<h2>What's the Point?</h2>
			<p>What problems does FITM address that existing search or sharing tools don't?</p>
			<h3 class="subsection">Search Engines</h3>
			<p>
				Search engines help with indexing the web,
				but they don't think like people so they&apos;re limited in ability to understand your wishes and make useful recommendations. And they have some biases.
			</p>
			<p>
				Depending on your definition of quality, <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> <a href="https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors#top-8">as we know it</a> may or may not be relevant.
				Great things on the web may be absent in search results because they're not aggressively stuffed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_research">keywords</a>, or they're not linked from many other pages, or they're not associated with an advertised company <a href="https://digitalbrandinginstitute.com/improve-brand-signals-better-seo#:~:text=What%20Are,Signals?">brand</a>. Or, maybe a site ranks highly given specific search terms but is otherwise hard to discover. How could you even know to search for something <a href="https://presidentialham.com/">like this</a>? (safe for work.) Internet users who care most
				about result <em>novelty</em> don't necessarily benefit from these ranking metrics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Search engines also are incentivized to promote results from
				those who will pay for it. Maybe this is a
				feature, not a bug, depending on who you ask. Do ad budgets and marketing passion reliably produce high quality web content? If you're not sure about that, you may be in the right place. (You will never see ads on FITM).
			</p>
			<p>
				Arguably, a simple enough proxy for a link's quality is the number of
				<em>people</em> who decide, for one reason or another, to upvote it. It's then trivial to find good content by sorting on like count.
			</p>
			<p>
				But, of course, like count alone is not enough. That's why you can parameterize FITM searches with <em><a href="#cats">cat-stacking</a></em> and other filters. You can also order results by which are newest if you prefer that to the most-liked ones.
			</p>

			<h3 class="subsection">Reddit</h3>
			<p>
				Some might argue that the goal of categorizing web content was achieved years ago by Reddit.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reddit is an invaluable resource
				and a blessing to the Internet. It is an inspiration to FITM. But they are
				different in that Reddit is
				primarily a <em>communication</em> hub while FITM is primarily a <em>resource</em> hub. FITM is not meant for thematic
				discussion, only link sharing and
				discovery (with a few text submission actions in support of that goal: see <a href="#core-actions">Core Actions</a>).
			</p>
			<p>
				FITM also aims, through cat-stacking, to serve anyone
				interested in <em>intersecting</em> themes while Reddit is home
				to communities defined by a <em>single</em> theme.
			</p>
			<p>Traditional World Wide Web
				searches tend to implicitly treat search terms as if they are separated with an "OR" when perhaps what you what is for them to be separated with "AND." History AND comedy AND music AND videos. That search could very quickly escort you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6OOuPI5c0">this masterpiece</a>. (probably not safe for work.) You can be very specific this way and skip past any potential recommendations that are not exactly what you want.</p>

			<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

			<h3 id="global-tag-calculation" class="subsection">Global Tag Calculation</h3>
			<p>Note: <a href="/feedback">constructive criticism welcomed</a> for this system.</p>
			<p>For a cat to be added to link <code>L</code>'s global tags, it's <em>score</em> must be &ge;25% of the highest score among <code>L</code>'s cats.</p>
			<p><em>Scores</em> for cat <code>C</code> of link <code>L</code> are calculated as the sum of scores from each occurrence of <code>C</code> in one of <code>L</code>'s tags. Each score is weighted by the number of cats in the tag containing the occurrence.</p>
			<p>Weights for tag <code>T</code> are calculated as <em>lifespan overlap percentage</em> of <code>T</code>, divided by <code>T</code>'s number of cats. </p>
			<p>Lifespan overlap percentage for tag <code>T</code> of link <code>L</code> is the percentage of <code>L</code>'s time on FITM that  <code>T</code> has remained in its current state since creation or last edit.</p>

			<GlobalTagCalcDiagram />

			<h3 id="retrieving-metadata" class="subsection">Retrieving Metadata</h3>
			<p>FITM employs <em>very limited</em> use of automated website scraping in order to fetch metadata for submitted links. This includes a description (AKA "Auto Summary") and a preview image, which come from <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> properties and other meta tags in a page's HTML head. FITM metadata collection can be identified by requests coming from the <strong>FITM-Bot</strong> user agent.</p>

			<p>A max of 1-3 automated requests go out to each URL added here (FITM-Bot tries a couple times with different protocol prefixes, e.g., "https://" and "http://", if the first request fails). The goal is <em>not</em> to maliciously harvest other online material. It is ultimately to promote appreciation for good, public Internet sites by making them more visible. This automated scraping helps to cut down on link submission friction and pair links with eye-catching visuals, which should help encourage sharing and finding those sites here.</p>

			<p><strong>Anyone can have their domain added to a non-scrape list upon request, with no further questions</strong>. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:fitm-contact@proton.me">fitm-contact@proton.me</a> if you'd like that. Frankly though, it would be a strange decision. Bot traffic is minimal, and the point of sites being on FITM is to help them get more human visitors. If you don't want visitors, why make the site public in the first place?</p>
